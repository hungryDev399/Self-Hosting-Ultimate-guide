# How to Expose the nextcloud instance to the internet

## 

## Step 1: Install nginx proxy manager

### 1. Create a directory in the docker directory (change the directory names if you find them confusing)

```bash
cd docker && mkdir npm && cd npm
```

### 2. Create a new yml file and add the following contents to it (read the comments)

```bash
nano docker-compose.yml
```

```yml
version: '3'
services:
  app:
    image: 'jc21/nginx-proxy-manager:latest'
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:     # Change the ports if they are already used on your network
      - '80:80' 
      - '81:81'  # Remember this as it will be used for opening the dashboard
      - '443:443'
    volumes:
      - ./data:/data
      - ./letsencrypt:/etc/letsencrypt

networks:
  default:
    name: my-main-net
    external: false # Change based on your network (trail and error if not sure)
```

### 3. Create the container

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### 4. Open the dashboard in your browser and change your mail and password

```textile
http://<your server ip address>:81/login #change the port if you changed it in the compose file
# default mail: admin@example.com
# default password: changeme
```

### 

## Congrats! You now have nginx proxy manager up and running

## 

## To continue this tutorial you need to have a domain name tied to a static ip or dynamic dns. If you do not have this refer to "setting up DDNS""  and "managing and buying domin name" tutorials before you continue.

## 

## Step 2: Accessing nextcloud via your domain name

### 1. Forward the following ports on your router (How to do so is different for every router)

```textile
80
443
3478 # for nextcloud talk only
3012 # for nextcloud talk only
```

### 2. Create a new proxy host using nginx proxy managerny adding your chosen domain name along with the server ip and the port used for managing nextcloud.

### 3. Add an SSL certificate by editing the proxy host. Go to the SSL tab, request a new let's encrypt certificate if ypu do not have one and enable all the security options. (optional)

### 

## Step 3: Add your domain name to the trusted domains list in the next cloud config

### 1. Access the container files

```bash
docker ps # to find the container name or id
docker exec -it <container_name_or_id> /bin/bash
```

### 2. install a text editor if ther is not one

```bash
apt update
apt install nano
```

### 3. Navigate to the directory that includes the config file amd open it

```bash
cd /var/www/html/config
nano config.php
```

### 4. Add your domain to the trusted domains array

### example before editing:

```php
'trusted_domains' =>
array (
  0 => 'localhost',
),
```

### example after editing:

```php
'trusted_domains' =>
array (
  0 => 'localhost',
  1 => 'yourdomain.com',
),
```

### 5. exit the container and restart it (you might not need to restart)

```bash
exit
docker restart <container_name_or_id>
```

## 

## Congrats! Write your domain name in your browser from any network and you will be able to access your nextcloud istance.
