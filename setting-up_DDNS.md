# Setting Up Dynamic DDNS Using No-IP

## 

## Step 1: check if No-IP DDNS is supported by your router (this step is very router dependent)

### 1. Open your router dashboard and navigate to the Dynamic DNS option and enable it

### 2. Under Provider check if No-IP is available

### 

## Step 2: choosing a host name and signing up

### 1. Open https://www.noip.com/

### 2. Choose a hostname example: test.ddns.net (to check if it is available), click sign up, fill in your information and then verify your email

### 3. Choose why are you are going to use the service for, choose their free plan, choose your host name and the record type (typically DNS host (A record)) and click create hostname

### 

## Step 3: Creating a username

### 1. Log in into you no-ip account you will be prompted to complete your account and add a username

### 2. click "add user name" under the username box in the basic info section and choose a unique username

## Step 4: Enable dynamic updating using your router

### 1. Open your router dashboard

### 

## Step 4: enable Dynamic updating via your router

### 1. Navigate to the DDNS option enabled in step 1

### 2. Choose the following: No-IP as your provider, username is the same one you created in step 3, password is your No-IP account password and hostname is the one you created in step 2.

### 3. Make sure that it's working by restarting your router to get a new ip and check if the ip that the hostname points to has cahnged or check if there is recent dynamic updates on the no-ip dashboard. (optional)

### 

## Congrats! Your DDNS is up an running and now you can point your

## domain to the no-ip hostname and the ip wil update automatically.

## Note: for the no-ip free tier in order for the ddn sto continue running you have to confirm that you are using it every 30 days (you will get an email notification).
